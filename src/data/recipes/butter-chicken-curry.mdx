### Ingredients

- 1⁄2 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets (or 4 cups pre-riced cauliflower)
- 1lb (450g) skinless chicken thighs, deboned and chopped
- 1 tsp grated ginger root 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp chili powder, divided
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1⁄2 medium yellow onion, diced
- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
- 1⁄4 cup raw cashews
- 1 tbsp garam masala spice blend
- 1⁄2 cup butter, diced

### Instructions

1. Place the cauliflower florets in a food processor and pulse until a rice-like consistency is achieved. Set aside.
1. In a medium bowl, combine the chopped chicken, ginger, garlic, salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoon of the chili powder. Mix well, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place the chicken in the fridge to marinate for 20 minutes.
1. After 20 minutes, add the coconut oil to a large frying pan placed over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.
1. Place the frying pan back over the heat and add the onions. Cook until the onions are translucent, then add the tomatoes, cashews, garam masala, and remaining chili powder. Mix well, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the pan from the heat and set the mixture aside to cool for 5 minutes.
1. Transfer the cooled sauce to a food processor. Add the butter and blend on high until the sauce is smooth, then return the sauce to the pan, place the pan back over medium heat, and add the chicken. Simmer for 5 minutes.
1. To assemble, add 1 cup of the cauliflower rice to each of 4 meal prep containers, then add 3⁄4 cup of the chicken and sauce to each container (the cauliflower rice will cook when you reheat the meals).
