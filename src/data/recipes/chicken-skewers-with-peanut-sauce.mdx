### Ingredients

- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into chunks
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce (or coconut aminos), divided
- ½ teaspoon Sriracha sauce, plus ¼ teaspoon
- 3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided
- Ghee, for oiling
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- Pink Himalayan salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. In a large zip-top bag, combine the chicken chunks with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, ½ teaspoon of Sriracha sauce, and 2 teaspoons of sesame oil. Seal the bag, and let the chicken marinate for an hour or so in the refrigerator or up to overnight.
1. If you are using wood 8-inch skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before using.
1. I like to use my grill pan for the skewers, because I don’t have an outdoor grill. If you don’t have a grill pan, you can use a large skillet. Preheat your grill pan or grill to low. Oil the grill pan with ghee.
1. Thread the chicken chunks onto the skewers.
1. Cook the skewers over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, flipping halfway through.
1. Meanwhile, mix the peanut dipping sauce. Stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, ¼ teaspoon of Sriracha sauce, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, and the peanut butter. Season with pink Himalayan salt and pepper.
1. Serve the chicken skewers with a small dish of the peanut sauce.
