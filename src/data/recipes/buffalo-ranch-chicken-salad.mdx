### Ingredients

- 1lb (450g) skinless chicken thighs, deboned
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1⁄4 cup butter
- 1⁄4 cup hot sauce (I prefer Franks® RedHot brand)
- 2 cups chopped iceberg lettuce
- 4 medium stalks celery, trimmed and chopped
- 2oz (60g) crumbled blue cheese

#### For the dressing

- 3 tbsp avocado oil mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp sour cream
- 1 tsp chopped fresh dill
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1⁄2 tsp dried parsley

### Instructions

1. Chop the chicken thighs into large chunks, yielding approximately 6–8 chunks per thigh, depending on the size of the thighs.
1. Add the coconut oil to a large frying pan placed over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and season with the salt and pepper. Cook for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned, then add the butter and hot sauce to the pan and stir until the butter is melted and the ingredients are well combined. Remove the pan from the heat.
1. Make the ranch dressing by combining the mayonnaise, sour cream, dill, garlic, and parsley. Stir well to combine, then transfer the dressing to an airtight container and place the container in the fridge.
1. In a medium bowl, make the salad by combining the lettuce, celery, and blue cheese. Mix well to combine, then equally divide the mixture between one end of each of 4 meal prep containers. Add the buffalo chicken to the opposite ends of the containers, seal, and transfer the containers to the fridge.
1. When you’re ready to serve, add 11⁄2 tablespoons of the dressing to the container and toss the ingredients to combine.
