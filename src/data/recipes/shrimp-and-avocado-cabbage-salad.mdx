### Ingredients

#### Salad

- 1 tablespoon ghee
- 1(ish) pound shrimp
- 1 small container cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 avocados
- Pink Himalayan salt
- 1⁄2 head of cabbage (usually purple but any will do)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup feta

#### Dressing

- 1⁄2 cup olive oil
- 1⁄4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1⁄4 cup full fat yogurt or mayo
- Sriracha to taste
- S&P to taste

### Instructions

1. In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, heat the ghee. Add the shrimp and cook. (I use cooked shrimp, so they take only about 1 minute to heat through, and I flip them halfway through cooking. Uncooked shrimp take about 2 minutes to cook.) Season with pink Himalayan salt and pepper. Shrimp are cooked when they turn pink and opaque.
1. Shred cabbage, halve tomatoes, and cube avocado.
1. Mix shrimp and veggies with remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Add dressing as you mix to your desired consistency.
1. Serve
