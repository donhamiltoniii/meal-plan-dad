### Ingredients

- 3 tsp fennel seed
- 3 tsp salt
- 5 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tsp paprika
- 2 lbs (800g) pork butt roast
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1.5 cups chicken broth

#### Slaw

- 1⁄2 large green cabbage, thinly sliced
- 3 tbsp sugar-free mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp white vinegar
- 1 tsp salt

### Instructions

1. Combine the fennel seed and salt in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Crush or grind the fennel seeds and salt until a fine texture is achieved, then transfer to a small bowl and add the garlic and paprika. Mix until the ingredients to form a paste.
1. Coat the pork roast with the paste, then place the pork roast fat-side-up in a slow cooker. Drizzle the olive oil over the roast, then add the chicken broth to the bottom of the cooker. The broth should reach halfway up the sides of the roast. If it doesn’t, add more water. Cover and set the cooker to cook on low for 8 hours.
1. Once the cooking time is complete, transfer the roast to a large bowl. Remove and discard the top fat layer and use 2 sturdy forks to shred the pork into long strips. Set aside.
1. Make the slaw by combining the cabbage, mayonnaise, vinegar, and salt in a large bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well combined. Transfer to an airtight container.
1. Divide the pork between 4 meal prep containers. When ready to serve, reheat the pork, then add the slaw.
