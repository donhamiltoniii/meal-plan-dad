### Ingredients

- 1 lb 70% lean ground beef
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 large red bell pepper, diced
- 1⁄3 medium green cabbage, thinly sliced
- 3 large eggs
- 1⁄3 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1.5 cups grated Cheddar cheese, divided

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
1. In a large frying pan placed over medium-high heat, combine the ground beef, salt, and pepper. Cook until the beef is browned, then transfer to a plate (do not drain the beef).
1. In the same pan, combine the bell pepper and cabbage. Cook until the cabbage is wilted and the bell pepper softens, then add the beef back to the pan. Stir to combine, then transfer the mixture to a large baking dish. Set aside.
1. Add the eggs to a medium bowl and whisk until they’re uniform in color. Add the whipping cream, Dijon mustard, and 1⁄2 cup of the cheddar. Stir until the ingredients are well combined, then pour the mixture over the beef mixture in the baking dish. Top with the remaining Cheddar and place in the oven to bake uncovered for 30 minutes or until the top becomes golden brown. Set aside to cool for 20 minutes.
1. Slice the cooled casserole into 4 equal-sized portions and transfer to meal prep containers.
