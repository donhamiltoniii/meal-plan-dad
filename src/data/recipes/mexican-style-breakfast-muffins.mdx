### Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon
- 6 large eggs
- 1⁄2 tsp paprika
- 1⁄4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tsp salt
- 1⁄2 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, grated

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 355°F (180°C) and line a muffin tray with 6 paper or silicone baking cups.
1. In a large frying pan, cook the bacon until it becomes slightly crispy (do not drain). Line each muffin cup with one slice of the bacon by forming a ring around the sides of the cups with each slice.
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Add the paprika, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Continue whisking until the ingredients are well combined.
1. Evenly divide the mixture across the baking cups, then sprinkle equal amounts of the cheese over the top of each cup.
1. Place the tray on a large baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the muffins from the oven and set aside to cool for 15 minutes. Transfer the muffins to 2 meal prep containers.
