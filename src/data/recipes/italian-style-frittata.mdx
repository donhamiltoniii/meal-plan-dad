### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 8.8oz (250g) bacon, diced (about 7 slices)
- 1⁄2 medium yellow onion, diced
- 1⁄2 medium red bell pepper, diced
- 1⁄4 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 9 large eggs
- 1⁄3 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus
- 2 tbsp for topping
- 2 tbsp butter

### Instructions

1. Preheat the broiler to high.
1. Place an 8-inch (20cm) cast-iron or oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the bacon, onions, and bell pepper. Cook until the bacon turns slightly crispy. Season the mixture with the salt and pepper, stir, then remove the skillet from the heat.
1. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs and 1⁄3 cup of the Parmesan cheese. Whisk until a uniform color is achieved.
1. Place the skillet back over the heat and add the butter. When the butter is melted, add the egg mixture and stir. Continue cooking until the eggs are nearly cooked but still slightly soft, about 2–3 minutes.
1. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the top of the frittata. Place the skillet under the broiler for 4 minutes or until the top begins to turn golden brown.
1. Remove the skillet from the oven and let the frittata cool completely before slicing it into 6 equal-sized portions. Transfer the portions to 6 meal prep containers.
